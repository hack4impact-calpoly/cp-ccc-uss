## Overview

### Purpose

The Central Coast Coalition for Undocumented Student Success (CCC-USS) is a collective of advocates and educators that challenges anti-immigrant and oppressive ideologies, institutional practices, and everyday actions that threaten undocumented and vulnerable communities. They work to create social change to ensure educational equity for all students and build capacity to support undocumented students in the Central Coast Region. This project will help streamline the volunteering process for both administrators and volunteers.
